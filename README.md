## Backlog

- All countries must be listed
- All countries are grouped by continent
- The flag must be shown with the name of the country
- We can search for a specific country
- The detail of the country must be seen when clicked on it
- The details must have the country name, region, population, the capital, currency, language, border countries (full name), flag
- We can add favorite countries, and this should be visible on the country name
