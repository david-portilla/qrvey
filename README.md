# Qrvey Frontend Test
We need to build an app where the countries of the world can be listed from the provided endpoint and the detail of the country could be shown when clicked on it, for this we're gonna have the following requirements:

## ⚙️ Install dependencies and run the app

- `npm install`
- `npm run dev`
- `npm run build`

## Backlog

- All countries must be listed
- All countries are grouped by continent
- The flag must be shown with the name of the country
- We can search for a specific country
- The detail of the country must be seen when clicked on it
- The details must have the country name, region,  population, the capital, currency, language, border countries (full name), flag
- We can add favorite countries, and this should be visible on the country name

# Nice to have
- Save favorites using any frontend database
- Handmade components (Only can use an icon font)
- Use custom elements API (vanilla js or any web components library)
- For this test we're gonna use this endpoint to retrieve the list of all countries: https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/all
- We will be watching best practices, design patterns, semantic, knowledge about the latest web standards and APIs, code order and - components documentation.
- Expected result
- Demo url (could be a codepen for web components)
- Git repository
